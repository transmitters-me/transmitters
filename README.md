# Transmitters

Everyone is an antenna.

A map where users can broadcast messages to listeners in an user-delimited area. For example, a person who is interested in immigration news will see when their local immigration office broadcast news. On their side, workers from the immigration office can listen to messages about immigration and get in contact with the poster. Same thing for people who want pizza and pizza restaurants, for example.
